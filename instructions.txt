Objectives

The goal of this exercise is to build a dynamic image gallery which adds the necessary HTML elements to a document in order to display images from a folder on your computer. A responsive design is expected.

This is quite a fast, straightforward assignment, therefore it mainly serves the purpose of testing attention to detail, previously obtained knowledge, and clean coding skills.

Requirements

    The HTML file must contain nothing other than the structure described in HTMLStructure.jpg

    Using JavaScript, insert all the HTML elements necessary to build a grid-based image gallery

    Store the image names you intend to use in an array

    Keep the images reasonably small in filesize (~100 KB)

    Shuffle the array using the sort() method. Use the function described in RandomSort.jpg as an argument to sort(), however it must be implemented as an arrow function

    When a gallery image is clicked, it must link to the image itself

    Set all styles and attributes dynamically with JavaScript
    
    Add a header and footer of your choice for the page
